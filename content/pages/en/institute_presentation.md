# Activating collective intelligence with the best of research

The Paris Institute for Advanced Study is an international research institution with strong roots in the humanities and social sciences, and is a partner of the main higher education and research establishments in Paris and the surrounding area. 

It develops high-level international research that is innovative and contributes to our understanding of the world and its transformation. With the aim of decompartmentalising research, the Institute also organises events bringing together academics, the general public, industrialists and political decision-makers to discuss current and future societal challenges.
